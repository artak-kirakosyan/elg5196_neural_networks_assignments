Assignments from ELG5196: Neural Networks course

This repository contains the code written in the scope of the mentioned course.

The task of the first assignment was to implement a backpropagation algorithm from scratch.
Then use the backpropagation to train a small network to immitate an XOR boolean funciton.

Second assignment required to implement a convolutional neural network from scratch.
Then use that algorithm combined with the backprop of the first assignment and train a CNN to classify digits from a small
binary picture.
